## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a back-end for a sporting goods website.
The database will consist of the items that are sold in the stores, the store 
locations, and a collection of several users' login info. The info will be 
accessible by using the handlebars to create a front-end which will consist of
a main page of the store. The main page will include a login tab and a nav tab
to the soccer items page and the baseball items page. On both the soccer and 
bassball page will be an option to both view and update items.

## Installation Instructions
The project works with a lot of packages that need to be installed. The first thing
you want to do after cloning/importing this project is to go to the command line 
and enter the following commands:
- __"npm install -g nodemon"__  
- __"npm install express"__
- __"npm install express-session"__ 
- __"npm install express-handlebars"__
- __"npm install sequelize"__
- __"npm install connect-session-sequelize"__
- __"npm install mysql2"__
- __"npm install bcrypt"__
- __"npm install dotenv"__

These installs can be combined into 1 install except for nodemon (-g is needed).
To make sure that everything is installed properly, run the command: 
- __"npm list"__
and check if there are any missing packages needed. Next, create a .env file
in the root folder of the project. Enter into the file:

DB_NAME='sportingGoods_db'
DB_USER='[your username for mysql]'
DB_PW='[your password for mysql]'

Finally, to start the server you need to enter the command: __nodemon start__.
Open the browser and go to: __http://localhost:3003/__ to open the website.
