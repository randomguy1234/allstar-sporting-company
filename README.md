## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a back-end for a sporting goods website.
The database will consist of the items that are sold in the stores, the store 
locations, and a collection of several users' login info. The info will be 
accessible by using the handlebars to create a front-end which will consist of
a main page of the store. The main page will include a login tab and a nav tab
to the soccer items page and the baseball items page. On both the soccer and 
bassball page will be an option to both view and update items.
